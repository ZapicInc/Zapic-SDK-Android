# Zapic Android Demo

This project includes a [Zapic Android demo game](zapic-demo) configured with the Zapic SDK for Android.

[<img alt="Get it on Google Play" height="100" src="https://play.google.com/intl/en_us/badges/images/generic/en_badge_web_generic.png" />](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zapic.androiddemo)

The demo game is very simple. The activity counts the number of pixels as a player drags their finger across the background image. After the player drags their finger, the activity submits a gameplay event with a `DISTANCE` parameter that includes the total number of pixels. See [lines 138-139 in MainActivity.java](zapic-demo/src/main/java/com/zapic/androiddemo/MainActivity.java#L138-L139).

The activity includes a Zapic branded button (required by the [Terms of Use](https://www.zapic.com/terms/)) that opens Zapic and shows the default page. See [line 71 in MainActivity.java](zapic-demo/src/main/java/com/zapic/androiddemo/MainActivity.java#L71).

The activity also includes a "Challenges" button that explicitly opens the challenges page for the current game. See [line 79 in MainActivity.java](zapic-demo/src/main/java/com/zapic/androiddemo/MainActivity.java#L79).

Try it out! Get it on Google Play, make a friend on Zapic, and challenge your friend to collect the most number of pixels.
